# StockFolio

[SEI34 Project 2] StockFolio is a one-stop dashboard that allows users to track their portfolio, and research and track any US-Listed stocks.

## Description

StockFolio is a React application. Users will search for any particular stocks to do their research, and add the stock to their watchlist or add it to their portfolio. However, as this is a front-end application, the information will not be stored in a database (to be improved in future iterations).
